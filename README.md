## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


I do not send the data anywhere, but all the rest of the functions work properly.
Also, i did not buy the access to figma file, so everything was done from the pictures, and might differ sufficiently. With figma it is always easier.
## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first ever popup and alive form. I learned a lot more about positioning and the positioning context.
Also i tried to make some little animations, which was very interesting. Now i can do border with linear gradient, using pseudo-elements. I tried to make it with border-image at first, but it does not allow border-radius.

Thus I can`t send forms of validate them correctly, i challanged myself to write a RegExp for the email. It was hard at first to read about this crazy sintax, but i love the result '/^[A-Za-z0-9\_\.]{1,}\@[A-Za-z0-9]{2,}\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$/'


### Continued development

My big goal is to master animations, forms styles, form sending and promises in js. Also currently i am focused on better accesability and clearer markup.
